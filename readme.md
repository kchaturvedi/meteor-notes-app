# The Notes App üìù

This is a notes application built on the fantastic [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) JS app platform and the robust [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) front-end framework. It is deployed to the amazing and versatile [Heroku](https://heroku.com) PaaS.

I built this in order to practice and further my skills in Meteor, React, and modern web app development.

For testing, I used [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) and [AirBnB Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/).

## Features üß∞
#### Auto-Save
It's 2018... no more clicking an image of a floppy disk (what are *those*?)

#### Public Note Sharing (read-only for now)
With the flick of the Sharing Switch, you can get a public link directly to your note.

Click on the link to copy it to the clipboard. Share this link with anyone and they will see a read-only version of your note.

#### Live Updating
When you have shared your note, any and every person viewing your note will see the changes updated live!
